# F1-Analysis

Here I will include some of the projects I have worked on while analyzing different Formula 1 races from the 2023 season.

The notebooks are made in google colab, so there is specific code for that environment, but it is easy to adapt it to another programme.

Some of these analysis were also made in my twitter account (@DataF1_ and @DataF1_es for spanish content), with a further development and explanations of each of the plots of the Formula 1 races.
